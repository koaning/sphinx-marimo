Gallery Examples
================

This page demonstrates the integration between Sphinx Gallery and Marimo. Each example below shows a static version generated by Sphinx Gallery, along with download links and a **launch marimo** button for interactive exploration.

The examples are automatically generated from Python scripts in the ``gallery_examples/`` directory. When you click the red "launch marimo" button, you'll open an interactive version of the notebook that runs entirely in your browser using WebAssembly.

Key Features
------------

- **Static Documentation**: Beautiful rendered examples with syntax highlighting and output
- **Download Options**: Get the original Python script or Jupyter notebook version
- **Interactive Launch**: Click "launch marimo" to explore with live widgets and real-time updates
- **Seamless Integration**: Buttons automatically appear alongside existing Binder/JupyterLite options

.. note::
   The Marimo launcher integration requires no changes to existing Gallery examples -
   it works automatically with any Gallery-compatible Python script.
